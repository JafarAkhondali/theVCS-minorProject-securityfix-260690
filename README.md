# Steps To Follow To Add New Project

###### 1. For front-end copy content from base.html and then use distributed template to add your content.
###### 2. Always write you content from line 110 between (content comments). 
###### 3. Add you project in server.py ml_box or tool_box accordingly (line no 10, 14). Example:
###### if my project is ml based like: "Olympian Recognizer", then I will add it into ml_tool as,
```
ml_box = {
  ........
  ........
"Olympians Recognizer": "olympians_recognizer",
}
```

**"Olympian Recognizer" is the option that you want to show in frontend in list of ML Box**



**"olympians_recognizer" is the name of html file that you have created in clients folder**
